# Welcome to my personal Github

I'm obsessed with using the latest machine learning stuff to solve problems in insurance and finance (my background in physics and economics helps a ton!).  I've tackled cool projects in areas like pricing, image stuff, building private and open source Python packages, and even getting computers to understand language.

But code isn't everything! I also lead projects, making sure tech and strategy work together seamlessly.  I've run workshops and seminars to share my knowledge and help others understand how complex tech can be applied in the real world.  Basically, I love guiding projects and teams to bring innovative ideas to life, all while keeping an eye on the bigger business picture.
